# Asset Rights and Attribution

Use only assets you have rights to. Document the source and license (or your authorship) for each file you add under `assets/`.

Template (copy per file):

- File: assets/<name>.<ext>
- Author / Source: <your name / link>
- License / Permission: <CC0 / CC BY / Purchased / Original / AI-generated (model + usage terms)>
- Notes: <proof of rights, screenshot of license, prompt/seed if AI>

Recommended:
- Keep animated GIFs < 2MB, gentle loop.
- Prefer original art or AI art you own rights to.
- Do not hotlink; store locally in `assets/`.
